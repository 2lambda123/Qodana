**Qodana** is a code quality monitoring tool to identify and suggest fixes for bugs, security vulnerabilities, duplications, and imperfections. 
It brings all the smart features you love in the JetBrains IDEs into your project pipelines. 
It takes different shapes: [Docker for any CI](Docker%20Image/README.md), [GitHub actions & application](GitHub/README.md), [TeamCity plugin](TeamCity%20Plugin/README.md), or a separate [cloud service](As%20a%20Service/README.md), but has a common goal: guiding users towards more robust, more maintainable, and healthier code.

**Qodana** will support all languages and technologies covered by JetBrains IDEs. We will
add them on a one-by-one basis and describe what one can expect on [each area](../Technologies/README.md). 

Check your PHP or Java/Kotlin projects today locally or in GitHub!


If you have TeamCity, add Qodana plugin to your installation and simple step to your builds!

If you want to have a cloud-service - spin TeamCity Cloud and contact us at qodana-support@jetbrains.com! We will add Qodana plugin to your installation!

Contact us at qodana-support@jetbrains.com or via [our issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=QD). We want
eagerly your feedback on what's already there and any features we miss. The more you tell us about your needs, the
closer we will be to fit you!
