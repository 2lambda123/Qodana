**Qodana** is a code quality monitoring tool to identify and suggest fixes for bugs, security vulnerabilities, duplications, and imperfections. 
It brings all the smart features you love in the JetBrains IDEs into your project pipelines. 
It takes different shapes: [Docker for any CI](Docker%20Image/README.md), [GitHub actions & application](GitHub/README.md), [TeamCity plugin](TeamCity%20Plugin/README.md), or a separate [cloud service](As%20a%20Service/README.md), but has a common goal: guiding users towards more robust, more maintainable, and healthier code.

**Qodana** will support all languages and technologies covered by JetBrains IDEs. We will
add them one by one, and describe what you can expect in [each area](General/supported-technologies.md). 

 - Check your PHP or Java/Kotlin projects today locally or on GitHub.

 - If you use TeamCity, add the Qodana plugin to your installation and then add a simple step to your builds.

 - If you want to have a cloud service, start with TeamCity Cloud and contact us at [qodana-support@jetbrains.com](mailto:qodana-support@jetbrains.com). We will add the Qodana plugin to your installation.

Contact us at [qodana-support@jetbrains.com](mailto:qodana-support@jetbrains.com) or via [our issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=QD). We eagerly want your feedback on what's already there and if there are any features that we miss.
