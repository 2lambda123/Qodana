# Qodana As a Service

If you need static analysis as a standalone cloud service, we offer to use [TeamCity Cloud](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/cloud/) with the Qodana plugin installed. Please create your instance and contact us at qodana-support@jetbrains.com - we will add the plugin to it!
Weâ€™ve created a playground for you to see Qodana in action for popular projects. Although this code runs daily on millions of machines, you can still find a couple of things that could be done better.
It doesn't necessarily mean the code is bad, it means that the technologies evolve, the surroundings change, and we need to keep up.
