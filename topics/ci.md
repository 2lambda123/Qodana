[//]: # (title: Integration with CI systems)

Qodana [linters](supported-technologies.md) are packed into ready-to-use [Docker images](docker-images.md). They can be integrated into virtually any Continuous Integration (CI) system in a similar manner.

Currently, %product% provides integration mechanisms with the following CI/CD system:

- [](qodana-azure-pipelines.md)
- [](circleci.md)
- [](qodana-github-action.md)
- [](gitlab.md)
- [](jenkins.md)
- [](teamcity.md)
