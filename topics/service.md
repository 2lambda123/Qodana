[//]: # (title: Qodana as a Service)

If you need static analysis as a standalone cloud service, we recommend using [TeamCity Cloud](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/cloud/) with the Qodana IntelliJ plugin. After creating your TeamCity Cloud instance, contact us at [qodana-support@jetbrains.com](mailto:qodana-support@jetbrains.com). We will add the plugin to it!

We've created a playground for you to see Qodana in action for popular projects. Although this code runs daily on millions of machines, you can still find a couple of things that could be done better.
It doesn't necessarily mean the code is poorly composed&mdash;it means that the technologies evolve, the surroundings change, and we need to keep up.
