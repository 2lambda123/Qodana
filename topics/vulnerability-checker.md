[//]: # (title: Vulnerability checker)

Relying on third-party software in your projects can become a source of vulnerability. To prevent security issues arising
from external packages, you can inspect your project using the Vulnerability Checker tool available in the 
[](qodana-jvm.md), [](qodana-python.md), [](qodana-go.md), and [](qodana-js.md) (only `npm` packages) linters 
starting from version 2023.2. This tool is designed using the 
[Checkmarx](https://checkmarx.com/) (c) data to check Gradle and Maven dependencies for known vulnerabilities 
and let you manage such cases by getting the information about vulnerable dependencies. Based on that, you can also take 
immediate action to address vulnerabilities by quickly migrating to a safe and stable version of the package without 
known vulnerability issues.

This feature is available under the Ultimate Plus [license](pricing.md) and its trial version.

## How it works

To inspect your code using the Vulnerability Checker, in the [`qodana.yaml`](qodana-yaml.md) file, enable 
the `VulnerableLibrariesGlobal` inspection: 

<chunk id="package-checking-enable">

```yaml
include:
  - name: VulnerableLibrariesGlobal
```

</chunk>

After your project is inspected, you can update the packages containing vulnerabilities to versions where such 
vulnerabilities are fixed, or switch to alternative packages.
