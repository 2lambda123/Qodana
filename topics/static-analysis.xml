    <p>Qodana implements the static analysis mechanism to automatically analyze your codebase without your participation.
        This means that you just run Qodana to inspect your code and expect recommendations on how you could improve
        your codebase. No other actions like running additional scripts, downloading external libraries, or any
        additional configuring is required.</p>

    <p>The second fact about static analysis says that your software can be explored by Qodana without building and
        deploying your software because code inspection is carried out on the codebase basis. So, no other activities are
    required from this side either.</p>

    <p>Once the static analysis stage is complete, you can explore vulnerabilities and faults in your code and see exact
        lines where Qodana detected imperfections. Qodana is equipped with multitude of
        <a href="code-inspections.xml">inspections</a> responsible for detecting particular problems. Of course, this
        happens before your software causes disaster, which in turn saves you a lot of nerves, money, and keeps your
        customers satisfied.</p>

    <p>To sum up, static analysis mechanism of Qodana is an efficient way for keeping your software quality under
        control. You can observe the list of currently <a href="linters.md">supported technologies</a>,
        but keep in mind that this list will be growing over time.</p>
