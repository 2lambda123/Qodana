### Analyse a project locally

To start, pull the image from Docker Hub (only necessary to get the latest version):

```shell
docker pull jetbrains/qodana-license-audit
```

and run the analysis locally:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -v <source-directory>/:/data/project/ -p 8080:8080 -e <language-version> jetbrains/qodana-license-audit --show-report
```

where `source-directory` points to the root of your project, `language-version` [specifies your project's language version](license-audit-docker-techs.md#specify-project-language-version).

Check the results in your browser at [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080).
