        <p>Using %product%, you can significantly enhance your code inspection workflow. To better achieve your
           goals, you may want to start using several features that are available out of the box: </p>

        <list>
            <li><a href="qodana-baseline.xml">Baseline</a> lets you group the existing code problems
                    into several categories to efficiently monitor your code evolution. </li>
            <li><a href="quality-gate.xml">Quality gate</a> helps you ensure that your code contains the minimum
            number of problems or is completely free of them. If combined with the baseline, this feature will make
            your code quality monitoring even more flexible.</li>
            <li>The <a href="qodana-php-language-upgrade.xml">PHP version migration</a> feature lets you monitor
            problems specific to a specific PHP version that may arise when you decide to migrate between versions.</li>
            <li><a href="license-audit.xml">License audit</a> lets you verify your project license for compatibility
            with the licenses of its dependencies. </li>
