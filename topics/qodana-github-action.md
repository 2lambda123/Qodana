Tools created by JetBrains are capable of detecting dozens of error-types and inconsistencies in your repository.
Their flexible mechanisms of resolving problems allow you to easier improve the code structure, conform your code to numerous guidelines and standards, detect performance issues, and so on.

And now with the Qodana App and Actions available in GitHub, all these features are just around the corner!

While the [Qodana GitHub App](qodana-github-application.md) supports only public repositories, for private repositories use the Qodana GitHub Action as described in this section.

**Qodana Github Action** is a more general tool for easier continuous code inspection.
Anyone with the write permission to a repository can set up a continuous code inspection with Qodana using GitHub Actions.
