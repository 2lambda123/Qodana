Tools created by JetBrains are capable of detecting dozens of error types and inconsistencies in your repository.
Their flexible mechanisms of resolving problems simplify improving the code structure, conforming your code to numerous guidelines and standards, detecting performance issues, and so on.

And now with Qodana App and Actions available on GitHub, all these features are just around the corner!

While the [Qodana IntelliJ GitHub App](qodana-github-application.md) supports only public repositories, for private repositories use the Qodana IntelliJ GitHub Action as described in this section.

The **Qodana IntelliJ GitHub Action** is a more general tool for easier continuous code inspection.
Anyone with the write permission to a repository can set up a continuous code inspection with Qodana using GitHub Actions.
