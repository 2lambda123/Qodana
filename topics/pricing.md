 ## Frequently asked questions

<!-- Trial version of the license needs to be used here -->
<!-- This needs to be grouped by licenses and Qodana Cloud -->
<!-- The EAP license needs to be addressed here -->

### What basic information do I need to know about Qodana licensing?

First of all, during the EAP (Early Access Program) stage, you can run %product% with the built-in EAP licenses. However,
the EAP period is limited by the 31st of July 2023. 

After the 31st of July 2023, you will have to switch to either a Community license, or a trial version of the 
Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license. In this case, you have two options: The Community license is not restricted in use, while the trial licenses are limited

* The Community license
* The trial versions of the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus licenses

The Community license is free for use; however, its functionality is limited only by the Community versions of %product% linters.  

The trial versions of the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus licenses are limited by a 60-day trial period. After the trial period 
expires, you have to purchase either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license to continue using %product%.  

### What do I need to do to start using Qodana?

<p>If you plan to choose either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus license, you need to create an account at 
<a href="https://qodana.cloud">Qodana Cloud</a>. During the onboarding stage, you will need to generate a public key that 
will be identified by %product%, and a project token for uploading %product% reports.</p>

<p>For the Community license, you can use %product% without any prerequisites. However, this type of license provides
restricted functionalities compared to the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses, see the <a href="pricing.md" anchor="license-comparison-matrix">comparison matrix</a>.</p>

If you would like to use your Community license with Qodana Cloud, you will need to create a Qodana Cloud account. 

### Can I try %product% before buying a license?

<p>
Yes, you can choose either the Ultimate trial or Ultimate Plus trial license, and start using %product% within a 60-day 
trial period. After 60 days, you need to buy either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license to continue using %product% in your 
projects. 
</p>

### Will I be notified when the license trial period comes to an end?

Yes, you will be notified about the trial period expiration. 

After the expiration, you will need to buy either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus 
license. Expired trial licenses cannot be prolonged.   


### What is a trial license?

A trial license is a time-limited version of either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license. Each trial license
duration is limited by 90 days, after which such license becomes expired and cannot be further used.

### Do I need to provide payment details for a trial license?

No, you do not have to provide any payment details until you decide to buy either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus
license of %product%, which you can do after the trial period ends.

### Can I switch between trial licenses?

Yes, you can switch between trial versions of the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses within your account.

### What are the license costs comprised of?

The total license costs are based on the number of contributors. A contributor is a person who commits to any number 
of Qodana Cloud projects within the same organisation and under a single license.

The number of contributors is calculated within a 90-day period. For example, if you buy a license for 10 contributors, 
but during the first 90 days this number raises up to 20, then in the following 90-day period the license costs will 
be recalculated for 20 contributors.

### Where Qodana stores all license information?

<p>All information about your Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses is stored by Qodana Cloud. This is why you need to 
create a Qodana Cloud account before running Qodana. Besides that, Qodana Cloud provides several 
<a href="cloud-use-cases.xml">helpful features</a>. </p>

### Which minimum steps do I need to perform in Qodana Cloud?

<p>All steps are described in the <a href="cloud-quickstart.md">Quick start</a> section of the Qodana Cloud documentation.</p>

### Are there any restrictions on using the Community license?

<p>This needs to be addressed!</p>


### What is the difference between the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses?

<p>Compared to the Ultimate license, the Ultimate Plus license additionally provides the following features:</p>

<list>
    <li><a href="license-audit.xml">License audit</a></li>
    <li><a href="taint-analysis.md">Taint analysis</a></li>
    <li>Package checking</li>
</list>

<p>Besides that, the Ultimate Plus license provides additional inspections that are not available in the Ultimate license.</p>
