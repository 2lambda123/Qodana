## Qodana licensing: an overview

During the EAP (Early Access Program) stage, you can run Qodana with the built-in EAP 
licenses free of charge. However, the EAP period will expire on July 31, 2023, and it cannot be extended.

After July 31, 2023, you will have to switch either to a Community license or a trial license for the Ultimate or 
Ultimate Plus versions.

The Community license is free to use, though its functionality is limited only to the Community versions of Qodana 
linters. Furthermore, it lacks numerous helpful [features](features.xml) that are available in the paid versions and 
only offers a limited period for [data storage](#pricing-data-storage) in Qodana Cloud.

The trial versions of the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus licenses are limited by a 60-day trial period. After the trial 
license expires, you'll have to purchase either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license to continue using Qodana.

 ## Frequently asked questions

<!-- This needs to be grouped by licenses and Qodana Cloud -->

### What do I need to start using Qodana?
{id="faq-start-using-qodana"}

1. You can navigate to the [Subscription Options and Pricing](https://www.jetbrains.com/qodana/buy/) page on the JetBrains
website and select the subscription option you would like to use. 

If you choose the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus trial license, you will be redirected to the 
[onboarding](cloud-onboarding.md) page of Qodana Cloud. This is also applicable for the Community license.

If you plan to purchase either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus license, you’ll be redirected to the JetBrains account 
page for payment details. After the payment, you will be redirected to the [onboarding](cloud-onboarding.md) page of 
Qodana Cloud.  

2. During the onboarding stage on the Qodana Cloud website, you’ll generate a public key that will be 
identified by %product%, as well as a project token for uploading %product% reports to your first project.
Although the Community license does not require a Qodana Cloud account, it will be more convenient to use Qodana Cloud
in this case too.

<note>The Community license provides restricted functionalities compared to the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses. See
[the comparison matrix](#license-comparison-matrix) for more details.</note>

### Can I try Qodana before buying a license?

Yes, you can choose either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus trial license and start using Qodana for a 60-day trial period. 
After 60 days, you’ll need to buy either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus license to continue using Qodana in your projects.

### Will I be notified when the license trial period comes to an end?

Yes, you’ll be notified when the trial period expires.

After its expiry, you’ll need to buy either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus license. Expired trial licenses cannot be extended.

### What are the EAP and trial licenses?

An EAP license is a license that gives you full access to Qodana until July 31, 2023. On August 1, 2023, all EAP 
licenses will expire, which means users will have to switch to a trial license.

A trial license is a time-limited version of either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license. Each trial license 
duration is limited to 60 days, after which this type of license is no longer valid and cannot be used further. To 
continue using %product%, you’ll have to buy a full version of your license.

### What are %product% linters and Qodana Cloud designed for?

Both %product% linters and Qodana Cloud are essential parts of the product named %product%. You can inspect your codebase
using %product% linters, and you can use Qodana Cloud for managing your project and licenses, as well as collecting
%product% reports in a single place. For more details, see the [](cloud-use-cases.xml) page of the Qodana Cloud
documentation.

### Can I use %product% linters only, without creating a Qodana Cloud account?

If you plan to use the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus licenses, you have to create an account at Qodana Cloud and accomplish
the [onboarding](cloud-onboarding.md) stage. For more details, see [the first question](#faq-start-using-qodana) in
this section.

You can run %product% linters available under the Community license without using Qodana Cloud, but there are no obstacles
to using Qodana Cloud in this case. 

### Do I need to provide payment details for a trial license?

No, you don’t have to provide any payment details until you decide to buy a license for either the Ultimate or Ultimate 
Plus version of Qodana, which you can do after the trial period ends.

### Can I switch between trial licenses?

Yes, you can switch between trial licenses for the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus versions one time using your 
JetBrains Account.

### What are the license costs comprised of?

The total license cost is calculated on the basis of the number of contributors. A contributor is a person who commits 
to any number of Qodana Cloud projects within the same organization and under a single license.

The number of contributors is calculated every 90 days. For example, if you buy a license for 10 contributors, 
but during the first 90 days this number rises to 20, then, in the following 90-day period, the license costs will be 
recalculated for 20 contributors.

### What is the minimum number of contributors I can buy the license for?

You can buy a %product% license for 3 (three) or more contributors.

### Where does Qodana store all license information?

All information about your Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses is stored by Qodana Cloud. This is why you need to 
create a Qodana Cloud account before running Qodana. Beyond this function, Qodana Cloud provides several other 
[helpful features](cloud-use-cases.xml).

### Which minimum steps do I need to perform in Qodana Cloud?

All the required steps are described in the [Quick start](cloud-quickstart.md) section of the Qodana Cloud documentation.

### Are there any restrictions on using the Community license?
