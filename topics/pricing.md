 ## Frequently asked questions

<!-- This needs to be grouped by licenses and Qodana Cloud -->

### What are the license basics?

First of all, during the EAP (Early Access Program) stage, you can run %product% with the built-in EAP licenses. However,
the EAP period will expire on the 31st of July 2023, and you cannot extend it.

After the 31st of July 2023, you will have to switch to either a Community license, or a trial version of the 
Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license. 

The Community license is free for use; however, its functionality is limited only by the Community versions of %product% 
linters. Besides that, it lacks a bunch of helpful [features](features.xml), and provides a limited period for data storage 
in Qodana Cloud.

The trial versions of the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus licenses are limited by a 60-day trial period. After the trial 
license expires, you have to purchase either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license to continue using %product%.  

### What do I need to start using Qodana?

<p>If you plan to choose either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus license, you need to create an account at 
<a href="https://qodana.cloud">Qodana Cloud</a>. During the onboarding stage, you will generate a public key that 
will be identified by %product%, and a project token for uploading %product% reports to your first project.</p>

<p>For the Community license, you can use %product% without any prerequisites. However, this type of license provides
restricted functionalities compared to the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses, see the <a href="pricing.md" anchor="license-comparison-matrix">comparison matrix</a>.</p>

If you would like to use your Community license with Qodana Cloud, you will need to create a Qodana Cloud account. 

### Can I try %product% before buying a license?

<p>
Yes, you can choose either the Ultimate trial or Ultimate Plus trial license, and start using %product% within a 60-day 
trial period. After 60 days, you need to buy either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license to continue using %product% in your 
projects. 
</p>

### Will I be notified when the license trial period comes to an end?

Yes, you will be notified about the trial period expiration. 

After the expiration, you will need to buy either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus 
license. Expired trial licenses cannot be prolonged.   

### What are the EAP and trial licenses?

An EAP license is a license that gives you full access to %product% until the 31st of July 2023. 
After the 1st of August 2023, all EAP licenses become expired, which requires switching to trial licenses.

A trial license is a time-limited version of either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license. Each trial license
duration is limited by 60 days, after which such license becomes expired and cannot be used further. To continue using
%product%, you have to buy a full version of your license.

### Do I need to provide payment details for a trial license?

No, you do not have to provide any payment details until you decide to buy either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus
license of %product%, which you can do after the trial period ends.

### Can I switch between trial licenses?

Yes, you can switch between trial versions of the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses one time using your JetBrains 
Account.

### What are the license costs comprised of?

The total license costs are based on the number of contributors. A contributor is a person who commits to any number 
of Qodana Cloud projects within the same organisation and under a single license.

The number of contributors is calculated within a 90-day period. For example, if you buy a license for 10 contributors, 
but during the first 90 days this number raises up to 20, then in the following 90-day period the license costs will 
be recalculated for 20 contributors.

### Where Qodana stores all license information?

<p>All information about your Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses is stored by Qodana Cloud. This is why you need to 
create a Qodana Cloud account before running Qodana. Besides that, Qodana Cloud provides several 
<a href="cloud-use-cases.xml">helpful features</a>. </p>

### Which minimum steps do I need to perform in Qodana Cloud?

<p>All steps are described in the <a href="cloud-quickstart.md">Quick start</a> section of the Qodana Cloud documentation.</p>

### Are there any restrictions on using the Community license?

No, you can use the Community version of %product% in open-source and proprietary projects.  

### What is the difference between the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses?

<p>Compared to the Ultimate license, the Ultimate Plus license additionally provides the following features:</p>

<list>
    <li><a href="license-audit.xml">License audit</a></li>
    <li><a href="taint-analysis.md">Taint analysis</a></li>
    <li><a href="vulnerability-checker.md"/></li>
</list>

<p>Besides that, the Ultimate Plus license provides additional inspections that are not available in the Ultimate license.</p>

### Which licenses are integrated into CI/CD pipelines?

All %product% licenses support integration with the CI/CD solutions already described in the [](ci.md) section.
