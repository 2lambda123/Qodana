[//]: # (title: Qodana Output Formats)

## Basic output

- **log/**&mdash;contains  `idea.log`, `gradle.log`, and so on.
- **projectStructure/**&mdash;Metainformation about your project: modules, frameworks/libraries, roots, and so on.
- **report/**&mdash;HTML report (generated via `--save-report`/`--show-report`)
- **profile.xml**&mdash;effective profile in the IDEA format: all inspections and their configurations. Depends on the configured profile, `qodana.yaml`, and the plugin list.
- **.descriptions.json**&mdash;descriptions for all inspections.
- **%InspectionId%.json**&mdash;contains all problems generated by the inspection with this ID: `%InspectionId%` message, place, severity, and so on.

An example of the Qodana command-line summary output:
```
---- Qodana - Code Inspection ----

2 problem(s) with Critical severity
- Category(ies): General

1 problem(s) with Moderate severity
- Category(ies): Code style

---- Problems reported: 3 ----
```
Full Qodana results are available in the file `results-allProblems.json` located in the `results-dir` folder.

## UI-compatible output

In addition to programmatic output, you can generate human-readable output in the HTML format by using the `--save-report` argument. 

### Local run

Due to JavaScript security restrictions, the generated report cannot be viewed via the `file://` protocol (that is, by double-clicking the `index.html` file). Instead, you can use the `--show-report` argument to serve the HTML report locally via the `http://` protocol.
To view the report in the already generated `report/` folder:
 - Docker
    
   ```shell
    docker run -it --rm -p 8000:80 -v $(pwd)/report:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
    ```  
 - Python  
    If you have python installed, you can serve current folder content via:
    
   ```shell
    cd report/
    python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
    # or
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
 - PHP  
    If you have PHP installed, you can serve current folder content via:
    
   ```shell
    cd report/
    php -S localhost:8000
    ```

The report is available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You can stop the web server by pressing `Ctrl-C`.

### GitLab CI

In case of [GitLab CI](https://github.com/JetBrains/Qodana/tree/main/Docker#quick-start-with-recommended-profile), you can directly view the report by opening `report/index.html` from artifacts. 

### GitHub action

For [Github Action](https://github.com/JetBrains/Qodana/tree/main/Docker#quick-start-with-recommended-profile), consider uploading artifacts to some [s3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/static-website-hosting.html) or using [Qodana Github App](https://github.com/JetBrains/Qodana/blob/main/GitHub/README.md#qodana-github-app) instead.
