[//]: # (title: Qodana Output Formats)

## Basic output

- **log/**&mdash;contains  `idea.log`, `gradle.log`, and so on.
- **projectStructure/**&mdash;Metainformation about your project: modules, frameworks/libraries, roots, and so on.
- **report/**&mdash;HTML report (generated via `--save-report`/`--show-report`)
- **profile.xml**&mdash;effective profile in the IDEA format: all inspections and their configurations. Depends on the configured profile, `qodana.yaml`, and the plugin list.
- **.descriptions.json**&mdash;descriptions for all inspections.
- **%InspectionId%.json**&mdash;contains all problems generated by the inspection with this ID: `%InspectionId%` message, place, severity, and so on.

An example of the Qodana command-line summary output:
```shell
---- Qodana - Code Inspection ----

2 problem(s) with Critical severity
- Category(ies): General

1 problem(s) with Moderate severity
- Category(ies): Code style

---- Problems reported: 3 ----
```
Full Qodana results are available in the file `results-allProblems.json` located in the `results-dir` folder.

## UI-compatible output

In addition to programmatic output, you can generate human-readable output in the HTML format by using the `--save-report` argument.
See [HTML report](html-report.md) section for details.
