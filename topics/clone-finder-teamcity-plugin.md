[//]: # (title: Clone Finder TeamCity Plugin)

[![official project](https://jb.gg/badges/official-flat-square.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

The Qodana Clone Finder plugin for TeamCity lets you extend Qodana static analysis with [clone finder](about-clone-finder.md) functionality.

## Quick start

* Ensure you have [Qodana](qodana-teamcity-plugin.md) plugin installed
* Install the Qodana Clone Finder plugin from [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15498-qodana)

The Clone Finder plugin extends Qodana build runner simplifying [Clone Finder docker image](clone-finder-docker-readme.md) usage.
Qodana UI will provide the handy way to inspect the results.

In the **Checks** section, you will find two inspections provided by Clone Finder:
* Code Fragments/Clones 
* Code Fragments/Clones with license violation
