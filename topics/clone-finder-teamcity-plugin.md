[//]: # (title: Clone Finder TeamCity Plugin)

[![official project](https://jb.gg/badges/official-flat-square.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

The Qodana Clone Finder plugin for TeamCity lets you extend Qodana static analysis with the [Clone Finder](about-clone-finder.md) functionality.

## Quick start

* Ensure you have the [Qodana](qodana-teamcity-plugin.md) plugin for IntelliJ Inspection installed
* Install the Qodana Clone Finder plugin from [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15498-qodana)

The Clone Finder plugin extends the Qodana build runner to simplify using the [Clone Finder Docker image](clone-finder-docker-readme.md).
The Qodana UI will provide the handy way to inspect the results.

In the [inspection profile](ui-overview.md#Adjust+your+inspection+profile), you will find two inspections provided by Clone Finder:
* Code Fragments/Clone 
* Code Fragments/Clone with different licenses
