[//]: # (title: About Qodana Linters)

[![official project](https://jb.gg/badges/official-flat-square.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

Qodana is more than just another static analysis plugin/UI/CI linter. It is a platform that allows companies to evaluate on multiple levels the quality of code they own, contract, or purchase.

First, it does help improve code outside an IDE both on a local machine or a build server and is designed to be seamlessly integrated in CI/CD pipelines or delivered as a cloud service.

Second, on top of bug-detection Qodana continuously extends its number of linters to provide complete Project Audit. 

Linters you can try right now:
* [Qodana IntelliJ](about-qodana.md) - all 'smarts' from IntelliJ IDEs
* [Qodana Clone Finder](about-clone-finder.md) - code duplication detection across different projects
  
Linter coming soon:
* Qodana License Audit - third-party licenses compatibility verification

Check the linter you want to try and follow the guidelines!
