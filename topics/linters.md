Qodana is more than just another static analysis plugin/UI/CI linter. It is a platform that allows companies to perform multi-level evaluations of the quality of code they own, contract, or purchase.

First, it does help improve code without relying on an IDE, either on a local machine or a build server, and it is designed to be seamlessly integrated into CI/CD pipelines or delivered as a cloud service.

Second, on top of the IntelliJ Inspection functionality, Qodana is extending its number of linters to provide a complete Project Audit. 

Linters you can try right now:
* [Qodana IntelliJ](about-qodana-intellij.md)&nbsp;&mdash; all 'smarts' from IntelliJ IDEs
* [Qodana Clone Finder](about-clone-finder.md)&nbsp;&mdash; code duplication detection across different projects

Check the linter you want to try to and follow the guidelines!
