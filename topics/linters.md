Qodana is more than just another static analysis plugin/UI/CI linter. It is a platform that allows companies to evaluate on multiple levels the quality of code they own, contract, or purchase.

First, it does help improve code outside an IDE both on a local machine or a build server and is designed to be seamlessly integrated in CI/CD pipelines or delivered as a cloud service.

Second, on top of bug-detection Qodana continuously extends its number of linters to provide complete Project Audit.
