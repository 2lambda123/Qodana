- Automate code reviews
- Provide unified coding standards
- Improve the quality of your software
- Run %product% wherever you want

Dive in to discover how we're reshaping software development.

## Automate code reviews

You can enable automatic code inspection based on the commits made to your VCS.

## Unify coding standards

Using available %product% features, you can decide which number of code problems will cause a build to fail, plan which
problems need to be solved right away, and which problems can be postponed, or automatically accept suggested quick-fixes. 

## Improve the quality of your software

%product% reports provide the detailed description of concrete problems and code fragments that contain such problems, 
the description of the problem, and recommendations about how this problem can be solved. Using these recommendations, 
you can improve your code. 

## Inspect monorepo projects

You can inspect your project in case it consists of several technologies. For example, you can inspect the project
using Java as a backend platform, and JavaScript as a front-end technology.

## Collaborate with other team members

[Qodana Cloud](https://qodana.cloud) is a cloud-based solution that helps you accumulate various Qodana reports and track the 
progress in your project(s) from a single point. These reports are available for all members of your teams within
your organization.

## Run %product% wherever you want

For several CI/CD %product% provides native solutions, for other
