**Qodana** is a smart code quality platform by JetBrains that transforms the way you view code quality. The platform can 
analyze code written in 60+ languages including Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Kotlin, Python, Go, and C#. 

Dive in to discover how we're reshaping software development.

## Automate code reviews

You can enable code inspection of each commit made to your VCS.

Here, %product% can inspect each commit before it becomes a pull request. The inspection report will be uploaded
to Qodana Cloud, so that you can overview it in details. To learn more about pull requests in GitHub, see the 
[](github.md#Pull+request+quality+gate) section.

## Unify coding standards

Using available %product% features, you can decide which number of to cause a build fail, plan which
problems to solve right away and to postpone, or automatically apply suggested quick-fixes to let your team save time. 
You can read more about available %product% [features](features.xml).

## Improve the quality of your software

%product% reports provide detailed description of concrete problems and code fragments that contain such problems, 
as well as recommendations about how to solve such problems. Using these recommendations, you can improve the quality of 
your product. To learn more about it, you can visit the [](ui-overview.md) section. 

## Inspect monorepo projects

%product% can inspect your project in case it uses multiple technologies. For example, if your project
uses Java as a backend platform, and JavaScript as a front-end technology, %product% can inspect it as described in the
[](monorepo-project.md) section.

## Collaborate with other team members

[Qodana Cloud](https://qodana.cloud) is a cloud-based solution that helps you accumulate %product% reports and track the 
progress in your project(s) from a single point. These reports are available for all members of your team(s). The detailed
description of Qodana Cloud is available starting from the [](cloud-about.xml) page.

## Run %product% according to your needs

Depending on your needs, you can run %product% either on your local machine, or integrate it into CI/CD pipelines.
For [](qodana-azure-pipelines.md), [CircleCI](circleci.md), [GitHub](github.md), and 
[TeamCity](teamcity.md) %product% provides native solutions. With other CI/CD systems, you can use 
[Docker images](docker-images.md).
