[//]: # (title: About Qodana)

[![official project](https://jb.gg/badges/official-flat-square.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

**Qodana** is a code quality monitoring platform that allows you to evaluate the integrity of code you own, contract, 
or purchase. It brings into your CI/CD pipelines all the smart features you love in the JetBrains IDEs as well as 
project-level checks like clone detection and license audit. 

Qodana provides you an overview of the project quality, lets you set quality targets, and track progress on them. You 
can quickly adjust the list of checks applied for the project and include or remove directories from the analysis.

## Qodana concepts 

Qodana employs several concepts, such as:

* <a href="static-analysis.xml">Static analysis</a> mechanism of Qodana means automated analysis of your codebase. 
* <a href="supported-technologies.md">Linters</a> are the components that let you analyze your code written in 
several programming languages and analyze clones in your code along with the license audit capabilities.
* <a href="code-inspections.xml">Code inspections</a> are the linter components responsible for correct analysis of 
specific code issues.

The diagram below shows how all these concepts are combined in Qodana.

## Qodana workflow

The diagram below provides an overview to a typical Qodana use-case.  

<img src="workflow.png" dark-src="workflow_dark.png" width="706" alt="Qodana workflow"/>

This diagram describes several steps:

1. Install Qodana using any of the <a href="install-qodana.xml">available distributive</a>

2. Take all necessary configuration steps:

<!-- The second point here needs to be referenced -->

   * Configure an inspection profile as described in the <a href="qodana-yaml.md">Configure profile</a> section
   * Study the list of parameters demonstrated in the ... section

3. Run Qodana to <a href="inspect-your-code.xml">inspect your codebase</a> using one of the linters and 
<a href="features.xml">features</a>. Here, you can run Qodana either [locally or within a CI/CD pipeline](#Running+Qodana).

Study inspection results generated by Qodana in the following formats:

* <a href="qodana-sarif-output.md">JSON files</a> formatted according to the SARIF specification
* HTML report described in the <a href="ui-overview.md">User interface overview</a> section

4. Based on the inspection results, you can improve your code in your IDE and run Qodana again to track the progress.  

## Running Qodana

You can run Qodana either locally or within a CI/CD pipeline. 

Running locally means that you run Qodana on a PC or server as a separate action. Inspecting your code within a CI/CD 
pipeline means that you will have information about your code while building and deploying your software.

## Distribution

Qodana linters are supplied in the following distribution formats and web services:
- [Docker images](docker-images.md)
- [GitHub Actions](github-actions.md) and [GitHub App](qodana-github-application.md)
- [Cloud service](service.md)
- [Plugins](qodana_plugins.md)

## Qodana playground

[Qodana Playground](https://qodana.teamcity.com/overview?mode=builds) is a sandbox environment which runs in the 
JetBrains cloud CI, TeamCity. You can use it to see Qodana in action and try various options yourself.
