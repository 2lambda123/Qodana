<!-- I need to mention here more about OS projects -->

This section explains how you can inspect your open-source projects using %product%, and how you can use %cloud% to 
overview %product% inspection results in a convenient form and free for open-source projects. 

## Before you start 

Make sure that you already know how to:

* [Inspect your code](inspect-your-code.xml) using %product%
* Configure %product% using [`qodana.yaml`](qodana-yaml.md) and [](docker-image-configuration.xml)
* Run %product% either [locally](Quick-start.xml#quickstart-analyze-project-locally) on in your [CI/CD pipelines](ci.md)
* [Forward reports](cloud-forward-reports.xml) to %cloud%

## Prepare %cloud%
<procedure>
<step>
Ð¡reate a <a href="cloud-get-access.xml">Qodana Cloud</a> account. 
</step>
<step>
In the %cloud% UI, navigate to your organization.

</step>
<step>
In your organization, create a <a href="cloud-teams.xml">team</a>.
</step>
<step>
In your team, create a <a href="cloud-projects.xml">project</a>. 
</step>
<step>
In the project, click <menupath>Generate token</menupath> to generate a project token.

</step>
</procedure>

<tip>To learn more about using project tokens, see the <a href="cloud-forward-reports.xml"/> section.</tip>

## Inspect your projects

You can inspect your codebase using methods described [on this page](inspect-your-code.xml). Additionally, you can 
configure:

* [Inspections](#Configure+inspections) that you would like to use
* [License audit](#Configure+License+audit) for checking license compatibility
* [Baseline](#Configure+baseline) for monitoring current and new problems
* [Quality gate](#Configure+quality+gate) for restricting the number of problems

### Configure inspections

By default, %product% inspects your code using the `qodana.starter` profile. You can use additional inspections by 
specifying the `qodana.recommended` profile in the [`qodana.yaml`](qodana-yaml.md) file contained in your project root: 

```yaml
profile:
    name: qodana.recommended  
```

To check the overall configuration of your project, you can employ the `qodana.sanity` profile:

```yaml
profile:
    name: qodana.sanity  
```

### Configure License audit

[License audit](license-audit.xml) lets you track compatibility of dependency licenses with your project license.

To enable License audit, use the `include` option of the [`qodana.yaml`](qodana-yaml.md) file in your project root:

```yaml
include:
  - name: CheckDependencyLicenses
```

### Configure baseline

[Baseline](baseline.xml) lets you create a snapshot of your project that will be used as a basis for 
subsequent analysis. To enable it, select inspections and download the `qodana.sarif.json` file. 

You can run %product% with the baseline enabled using the `--baseline` option:

```shell
--baseline <path-to-qodana.sarif.json>
```

### Configure quality gate

[](quality-gate.xml) lets you configure the ultimate number of problems that will cause a CI/CD pipeline failure.

Once configured, the quality gate will make your CI/CD system:

* Build the project only if the number of problems contained in it is below the configured threshold
* Accept only the pull requests containing problems below the configured threshold  

To enable the quality gate, you can use the `fail-threshold <number>` option.

### Types of Qodana reports

%product% can generate the following types of inspection reports: 

* Reports containing inspection results over a specific branch of your project
* Pull or merge request inspection reports generated by [GitHub Actions](#GitHub+Actions) and [GitLab CI/CD](#GitLab+CI%2FCD)

<!-- I need to add information about QODANA_TOKEN. Without this parameter, both examples are useless -->

#### GitHub Actions

Using this example, you can configure GitHub for:

* Forwarding inspection results to %cloud%
* Blocking the merge of pull requests if the quality gate has failed

Follow these steps:

1. Create an [encrypted secret](https://%github-secret%) with the `QODANA_TOKEN` name.
2. Create a new or open an existing GitHub workflow that invokes the Qodana Scan action.
3. Set the workflow to run on `pull_request` events that target the `main` branch, and forward reports based on the 
`QODANA_TOKEN` value. Instead of `main`, you can specify your branch here.

```yaml
name: Qodana
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/*'

jobs:
  qodana:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: 'Qodana Scan'
        uses: JetBrains/qodana-action@v2022.2.3
        env:
          QODANA_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.QODANA_TOKEN }}
```

4. Set the number of problems (integer) for the Qodana action [`fail-threshold`](#Configure+quality+gate) option.
5. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.
6. On the left menu, click **Branches**.
7. In the branch protection rules section, click **Add rule**.
8. Add `main` to **Branch name pattern**.
9. Select **Require status checks to pass before merging**.
10. Search for the `Qodana` status check, then check it.
11. Click **Create**.

#### GitLab CI/CD

Using this example, you can configure GitLab CI/CD for:

* Inspecting the `main` branch and all merge requests
* Blocking merge requests if the quality gate has failed
* Forwarding inspection results to %cloud%

Follow these steps to add a %product% runner to a GitLab CI/CD pipeline:

1. Create the [`QODANA_TOKEN`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) variable and save the %cloud% project token value in it 
2. Paste this sample to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file: 

```yaml
stages:
  - qodana

qodana:
  stage: qodana
  only:
    - main
    - merge_requests
  image:
    name: jetbrains/qodana-<linter>
    entrypoint: [""]
  script:
    - qodana --save-report --results-dir=$CI_PROJECT_DIR/qodana 
     --report-dir=$CI_PROJECT_DIR/qodana/report
     --fail-threshold <number>
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - qodana
```
In this sample, specify the %product% linter and the quality gate using `--fail-threshold` option. 
Using this configuration, %product% will inspect the main branch and all merge requests coming to your repository.

## Overview inspection results

After your project is inspected and inspection results are uploaded to %cloud%, you can overview results as shown 
[on this page](cloud-overview-reports.xml).
