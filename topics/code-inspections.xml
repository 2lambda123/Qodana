    <p>Each inspection is a set of conditions to check code, detect and correct abnormal fragments in it. Qodana
        inspections can find and highlight various problems, locate dead code, find probable bugs, spelling problems,
        and thus facilitate to improving the overall code structure.</p>

    <p>All inspections are highly configurable, so you can configure:</p>

    <list>
        <li>The inspections to run for your codebase</li>
        <li>Directories and files to include in your code checking</li>
        <li>Configure and use <a href="qodana-yaml.md">inspection profiles</a></li>
    </list>
